  <h2>Our Baked Goods</h2>

  <p>
    Here at the Black Goose Bistro, we like to start our day at the crack of dawn to bake our own muffins, bread, and dinner rolls.
    When we come in early to make, it's because we want to ensure that our guests here at the Black Goose Bistro get the freshest bread and muffins possible.
    Eating freshly baked goods, are a definite game changer when you are looking for a good restaurant in the area.
    Loaves that are not used that day are donated to the local food shelter.

  <p>
    People come from all over the world to enjoy our burgers that are made with unconditional love and passion.
    We grind out own locally-sourced organic beef and turker so you know it's fresh and free from fillers and other nonsense.
    Go for one of our creative topping combos or stick with the classics. All is up to you.

  <h2>Catch of the Day</h2>

<a href="fish.html"><img src="thumbnails/fish.jpg" alt="Catch the Fish Pic" align="center"></a>
  <p>
    Our chef works with the local fisherman to pick the freshest fish, the sea has to offer, for our daily seafood special.
    Our <em>Roast Cod Caponata with Roasted Potatoes</em> is an old favorite with our regulars. So it is definitely, something
    on the menu that is absolutely worth a try.
